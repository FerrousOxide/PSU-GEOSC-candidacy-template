## File and Directory Description
**README.md** - This document.

**Candidacy_Packet.tex** - The main LaTeX file.  Compile this file to make your packet.  No modification is needed.

**title/title.tex** - Title page of the packet. Fill in your name and your committee.  The PSU logo is not mine and PSU owns all rights.

**figures** - A directory to store figures in for the proposals.  You may put figures in the proposal directory as well, but I found it convenient to have them all in one spot.

**frontmatter/background.tex** - This section has all of your academic background and should be carefully updated.  You will need to have your past course work and future course work plans.

**prop1/prop1.tex** - Your first proposal goes here.  Make sure to stay within the department length limits!

**prop2/prop2.tex** - Your second proposal goes here.  Make sure to stay within the department length limits!

**biblio.bib** - BibTeX repository for the references.

## Instructions
To use these documents, simply update the contents of *title.tex, background.tex, prop1.tex, and prop2.tex*.  Compile the file *Candidacy_Packet.tex* to produce the final document.  I chose to store all of my figures in the figures directory and all of the references for both proposals in *biblio.bib*.  These can be split up if you wish.  

Any modifications and improvements are greatly appreciated.  Please send a pull request with your changes.  As always, this come with no warranty.  Use at your own risk.  Good luck on passing your candidacy exam!
